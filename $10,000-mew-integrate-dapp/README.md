# BOUNTY: Integarate Dapp
## Overview
Create any DApp using tools provided by MEW, and make it compatible with the current live [MyEtherWallet.com](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) version. This DApp can be anything, except gambling or other such regulated applications. We are looking for creative DApps that are useful to the Ethereum community. You can build upon existing Ethereum DApps or come up with something unique where you write your own smart contract. The sky is the limit.

## Reward: $10,000
The reward will be split between in-person and virtual contestants.

## Specs:
You can be as creative as you would like. We only ask that you use our UI components library. If you are not sure where to begin, you can read DApp integration [guide](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/blob/main/src/dapps/DAPP_INTEGRATION.md).
